# TradeTracker-wxWidgets
 TradeTracker using wxWidgets

**This is a very early code base for converting my Windows based TradeTracker application to cross platform using wxWidgets.**

The original TradeTracker software is located at: https://github.com/PaulSquires/TradeTracker

I am learning wxWidgets as I write this software so there will be **many** changes to the code.
